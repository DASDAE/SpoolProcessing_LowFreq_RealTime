# SpoolPorcessing_LowFreq
This is a temporary package for low-frequency processing on a spool of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data, and it will be merged into the [SpoolProcessing](https://github.com/DASDAE/SpoolProcessing) package. It uses [DASCore](https://dascore.org/) package and the ```lf_das.py``` script, and it is the modified version of Dr. Ge Jin's [DASLowFreqProcessing](https://github.com/DASDAE/DASLowFreqProcessing). 

Examples are available through ```low_pass_dascore.ipynb```Jupiter notebook.

Still under development. Use with caution.
