# SpoolPorcessing_LowFreq
This is a temporary package for low-frequency processing of a spool of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data using true low-pass filtering alongside a rolling mean processing. Additionally, it facilitates real-time DAS data processing, enabling either low-frequency or rolling mean processing directly on site.

This repository may be merged into the [SpoolProcessing](https://github.com/DASDAE/SpoolProcessing) package. It uses [DASCore](https://dascore.org/) package and the ```lf_das.py``` script, and it is the modified version of Dr. Ge Jin's [DASLowFreqProcessing](https://github.com/DASDAE/DASLowFreqProcessing). 

Examples are available through Jupyter notebooks.

Tested using DASCore v0.0.13

Still under development. Use with caution.
